# [C]hem[S]cribe

A Highly Extensible Chemical Formula Builder and Molecular Editor with Regulatory 
Intelligence written in Common Lisp, specifically for the
[clasp](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp) implementation.

This project is still in the ideation stage - I'm still in the process of 
determining the inner workings, let alone the UI system.  I am currently learning 
Common Lisp and figured this would be a great way to dive in!


## Goals

My first goal is to develop a simple database (integrated with JSON) that can 
store/access molecular, raw material, formula, and regulatory data types.  
Second is to develop the formula builder and Molecular editor backends.  Thirdly, 
is to develop the regulatory intelligence backend and begin work on the UI system,
particularly interesting in using CLOG or perhaps utilize clasp to develop
something that works with webassembly. 


## Hacking

I am currently using Fedora Linux (Workstation Edition) to build/hack on this 
program using the [clasp](https://github.com/clasp-developers/clasp) Common Lisp
implementation. I recommend using [ocicl](https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl) 
for dependency management.
