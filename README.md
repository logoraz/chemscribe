# ChemScribe (סוֹפֵר)

A Highly Extensible Chemical Formula Builder and Molecular Editor with Regulatory Intelligence
written in Common Lisp.

This project is still in the ideation stage - I'm still in the process of determining the inner
workings, let alone the UI system to implement it with (though considering CLOG).  I am still
learning Common Lisp and Guile and figured this would be a great way to dive in!


## Goals

My first goal is to develop a simple database (integrated with JSON) that can store/access
molecular, raw material, formula, and regulatory data types.  Second is to develop the formula
builder and Molecular editor UI's, perhaps using CLOG. Thirdly is to develop the regulatory
intelligence backend...


## Hacking

   Guix is the preferred development environment for now... To begin hacking, simply run
   the following:

```sh

  $ guix shell -m path/to/chemscribe/manifest.scm -- sbcl


```
